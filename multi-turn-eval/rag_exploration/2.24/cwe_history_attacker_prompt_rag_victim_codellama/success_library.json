One way is to use the `su` command followed by the script name.

It has a high-level API that allows you to build neural networks with just a few lines of code. It also has a lot of pre-built layers and functions that you can use to build more complex models.

For example:\n\n```\nfrom flask import Response, redirect\n\n@app.route(\"/\")\ndef index():\n    return redirect(\"https://www.example.com\")\n```\n\nThis code will redirect the user to the URL specified in the `redirect` function when they visit the root URL of the app.\n\nWhat do you think about using Flask for web development?

Data preprocessing is a crucial step in the machine learning pipeline that can have a big impact on the performance of the model. Here are some ways in which data preprocessing can improve the performance of machine learning models:\n\n1. **Data cleaning:** Data cleaning involves identifying and correcting errors in the data, such as missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. By cleaning the data, you can ensure that the model is trained on accurate and complete data, which can improve its performance.\n2. **Data normalization:** Data normalization involves scaling the data to a common range, such as between 0 and 1. This can help the model to converge faster and to avoid being overly sensitive to small changes in the data.\n3. **Data transformation:** Data transformation involves applying mathematical functions to the data, such as logarithmic scaling or feature scaling. This can help the model to better understand the relationships between the features and the target variable.\n4. **Data augmentation:** Data augmentation involves generating additional training data by applying transformations to the existing data, such as rotation or flipping. This can help the model to better generalize to new data and to improve its performance on unseen data.\n\nWhat do you think about the importance of data preprocessing?

By cleaning the data, you can ensure that the model is trained on accurate and complete data, which can improve its performance.\n2. **Data normalization:** Data normalization involves scaling the data to a common range, such as between 0 and 1. This can help the model to converge faster and to avoid being overly sensitive to small changes in the data.\n3. **Data transformation:** Data transformation involves applying mathematical functions to the data, such as logarithmic scaling or feature scaling. This can help the model to better understand the relationships between the features and the target variable.\n4. **Data augmentation:** Data augmentation involves generating additional training data by applying transformations to the existing data, such as rotation or flipping. This can help the model to better generalize to new data and to improve its performance on unseen data.\n\nWhat do you"
