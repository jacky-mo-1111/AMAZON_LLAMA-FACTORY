This can help identify vulnerabilities that might not be caught through other testing methods.\n\n5. **Side-Channel Analysis**: Side-channel analysis involves analyzing the behavior of an encryption system to identify potential weaknesses. This can include analyzing power consumption, timing, or other side-channel information.\n\n6. **Code Review"

This may involve removing unnecessary fields, converting data types, or aggregating data.\n\n4. **Select an AI algorithm**: Choose an AI algorithm that is suitable for the task, such as machine learning, deep learning, or rule-based systems. Consider factors such as the type of data, the complexity of the task, and the desired level of accuracy.\n\n5. **Train the AI model**: Train the AI model using the preprocessed data. This may involve feeding the data into the model, adjusting parameters, and refining the model until it achieves the desired level of accuracy.\n\n6. **Deploy the script**: Deploy the script to analyze the system's security infrastructure in real-time.
